# sisense_angular
Showing up Sisense dashboards/ widgets inside an Angular 8 app without using iFrames

Successful PoC, based on Takashi Binns code. Url to code: https://support.sisense.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360013085874-Sisense-js-with-Angular-6

## Notes
1. take care of prefix while naming dashboards and dont forget to give title to widgets
2. If you have more than 1 dashboard, Angular app will show all widgets together on screen without any differentiation that which widget belongs to what dashboard.
